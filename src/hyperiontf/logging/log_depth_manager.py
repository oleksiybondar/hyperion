Module: Hyperion Testing Framework Log Depth Manager
=================================================

This module provides a singleton class, LogDepthManager, for managing the logging depth. The logging depth is a
class-level attribute that tracks the level of nested logging, allowing for indentation of log messages to indicate
hierarchical relationships.
