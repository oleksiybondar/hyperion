class Expect:
    """
    A central class in the testing framework that provides a fluent interface for asserting
    various conditions on a given value. It dynamically selects an appropriate strategy
    based on the type of the actual value to perform type-specific or general assertions.

    This class is relatively private and is not intended for direct use in tests; instead,
    helper methods `expect` and `verify` are provided for public use. The lowercase `expect`
    function is an entry point that facilitates assertions, raising exceptions on failure,
    whereas `verify` is used for non-assertive checks, logging outcomes as informational
    without raising exceptions, making it suitable for more flexible validation scenarios.

    Attributes:
        actual_value (Any): The value to be tested or verified.
        is_assertion (bool): A flag indicating if the Expect instance is being used for
                             assertions (True) or verifications (False).
        logger (Optional[Logger]): Logger object for logging outcomes of the checks.
        sender (Optional[str]): Identifier for the sender of log messages.
        strategy (Union[DefaultStrategy, Type[DefaultStrategy]]): The strategy object
                     determined based on the actual value's type, responsible for
                     executing the specific comparison methods.

    The class originally leveraged Python's dynamic `__getattr__` feature to proxy method
    calls to the appropriate strategy, allowing for a compact implementation. However, this
    dynamic approach was revised in favor of explicitly defining wrapper methods for each
    strategy. This decision, influenced by the capabilities of ChatGPT, aimed to enhance
    the developer experience by providing clear type hints and verbose docstrings that
    detail cross-referencing types and expected behaviors, thus making the API more
    intuitive and the code more maintainable and extendable.

    The extensive logging capability of the `Expect` class and its strategies is a key
    feature, offering detailed insights into the checks performed, especially valuable
    in non-assertion contexts where results are logged for informational purposes,
    regardless of the outcome. This approach ensures that users benefit from comprehensive
    feedback on their tests' behavior and outcomes.

    Example Usage:
        expect(some_value).is_none()  # Checks if some_value is None, raising an exception on failure.
        verify(another_value).is_int()  # Checks if another_value is an integer, logging the outcome.

    The STRATEGIES_MAP dictionary maps types to their corresponding strategy classes,
    allowing the Expect class to dynamically select the appropriate strategy based on
    the actual value's type, facilitating a wide range of assertions and verifications
    across different data types and conditions.
