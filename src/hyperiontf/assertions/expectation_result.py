class ExpectationResult:
    """
    A class to represent the result of an expectation in a testing framework.

    This class plays a crucial role in handling both verifications and assertions
    within the framework. It encapsulates the outcome of a comparison, including
    its state (pass/fail), actual and expected values, and other pertinent details.
    The class provides enhanced logging capabilities, ensuring detailed information
    is available for debugging and analysis. In the context of verifications, it logs
    messages at different levels (debug, info, warning), aiding complex logic analysis.
    For assertions, it logs success messages and raises exceptions on failures.

    Attributes:
        result (bool): The boolean outcome of the comparison.
        actual_value (Any): The actual value obtained in the comparison.
        expected_value (Any): The expected value in the comparison.
        method (str): The comparison method used.
        is_assertion (Optional[bool]): Flag indicating if the result is from an assertion.
        logger (Optional[Logger]): Logger object for logging the result.
        sender (Optional[str]): Identifier of the result's sender.
        diff (Optional[str]): String describing the difference between actual and expected values.
        human_readable_description (Optional[str]): Human-friendly description of the comparison.
        extra (Optional[dict]): Additional information for logging.

    The class also includes properties for quick access to the type of expectation,
    its status, a descriptive action, and detailed comparison information. These properties
    enhance the readability and utility of the class in various testing scenarios.

        Args:
            result (bool): The outcome of the expectation. True indicates a pass (expectation met),
                           and False indicates a failure (expectation not met).
            actual_value (Any): The actual value obtained during the expectation evaluation.
                                This can be of any type depending on the context of the test.
            expected_value (Any): The expected value against which the actual value is compared.
                                  This can vary in type based on the expectation.
            method (str): The name of the method used for the expectation. This is used for logging
                          and reporting purposes to identify the specific expectation.
            is_assertion (Optional[bool]): A flag indicating whether the expectation is an assertion.
                                           Defaults to True. Assertions typically raise an exception
                                           on failure, whereas verifications log the outcome.
            logger (Optional[Logger]): The logger object used for logging the outcome of the expectation.
                                       Defaults to a logger obtained from `getLogger(LoggerSource.EXPECT)`.
            sender (Optional[str]): An identifier for the sender of the log messages.
                                    Defaults to `LoggerSource.EXPECT`.

            prefix (Optional[str]): A string...
            extra (Optional[dict]): Additional data to be included in log messages.
                                    This can be used to pass extra information relevant to the expectation.

        This constructor sets up the expectation result with all necessary details for effective
