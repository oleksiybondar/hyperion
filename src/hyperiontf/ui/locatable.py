class LocatableElement:
    """
    Represents a locatable element within a web page or application. This class is responsible for locating and providing
    access to a specific element or a collection of elements based on the provided locator strategy.

    The `LocatableElement` class follows the single responsibility principle, separating the responsibility of locating
    elements from other aspects of the class.

    Attributes:
        parent (object): The parent element or container that contains this element.
        locator (By | dict): The locator strategy used to identify the element. It can be a `By` object or a dictionary
                             of locators categorized by platform, operating system, and viewport.
        name (str): A descriptive name for the element used for logging and identification purposes.

    Public Properties:
        platform (str): The platform of the element, determined by the document holder's platform.
        viewport (str): The viewport of the element, determined by the document holder's viewport.
        os (str): The operating system of the element, determined by the root element's operating system.
        root (object): The root element or container of the current element.
        document_holder (object): The document holder that contains this element.

    Methods:
        find_itself(retries: Optional[int] = config.element.search_attempts):
            Searches and locates the element based on the provided locator strategy.

    Private Methods:
        _fetch_elements_item(actual_locator: By | dict, retries: Optional[int] = config.element.search_attempts):
            Searches and locates multiple elements based on the provided locator strategy.
        _exec_search(actual_locator: By | dict, retries: Optional[int] = config.element.search_attempts):
            Executes the element search based on the provided locator strategy.
        _fetch_scope_object(actual_locator): Fetches the scope object for the element search based on the locator.
        _fetch_actual_locator(locator: Optional[By | dict] = None) -> By:
            Fetches the actual locator for the element search, considering platform, operating system, and viewport

        Explanation:
        This method needs to check if self.parent is an instance of the IFrame class. However, IFrame is a child class of
        LocatableElement. Placing the import of IFrame at the top of the file would lead to a cyclic import issue.

        Cyclic imports occur when two or more modules depend on each other, directly or indirectly. In this case, if
        IFrame is imported at the top of the file that contains LocatableElement, and IFrame imports LocatableElement,
        it creates a circular dependency that Python cannot resolve.

        To avoid this, the import of IFrame is placed within the method _fetch_scope_object. This ensures that the
        IFrame class is only imported when this method is executed and not during the initial module import. By
        doing so, we prevent the cyclic import issue, and the code remains functional without any import errors.
