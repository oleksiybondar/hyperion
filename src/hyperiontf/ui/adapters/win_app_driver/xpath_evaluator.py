class XPathEvaluator:

    XPathEvaluator provides a custom implementation of an XPath engine for the WindowsApplicationDriver client.
    This class enhances the native WinAppDriver XPath engine by enabling searches from an element context and supporting
    complex XPath expressions, including axes that are not available natively in WinAppDriver.

    Attributes:
        bridge (object): A bridge instance responsible for executing commands, managing sessions, and communicating with the WinAppDriver.
                         It is also responsible for converting raw XPath results into a usable format (e.g., a list of element instances).

        Initializes the XPathEvaluator with a bridge instance.

        Args:
            bridge (object): A bridge object that manages communication between the framework and the WinAppDriver server.
                             It provides access to execute commands and retrieve session-specific information, and it handles
                             conversion of raw results into the expected element format.

        Finds elements in the document or within a base element's context using the provided XPath expression.

        This method determines whether the XPath expression should be evaluated globally (from the document root) or
        locally (relative to a base element). To improve performance, logging is suppressed temporarily to avoid
        unnecessary logs when dealing with large XML structures. The results are processed via the `bridge` to return
        elements in the framework's expected format.

        Args:
            xpath (str): The XPath expression used to search for elements. If it starts with '//', the search is global.
            base_element (optional): The base element to search within. If provided, the search will be scoped to descendants
                                     of this element. If not provided, the search will be global.
